# Food Delivery Time Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the delivery time of food orders based on various features. By accurately forecasting delivery times, restaurants can enhance customer satisfaction and optimize their delivery operations.

## Problem Statement

The delivery time for food orders can vary due to numerous factors, including order size, distance, traffic conditions, and restaurant preparation times. This project seeks to create a predictive model that helps restaurants manage customer expectations and streamline their delivery processes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical food delivery orders, including features such as:

- Order size
- Distance to delivery location
- Traffic conditions
- Restaurant preparation time
- Delivery time

*The dataset is sourced from [source or link to dataset]*.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and model building.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building predictive models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for coding and documentation.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to identify trends and relationships between features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Food_Delivery_Time_Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Food_Delivery_Time_Prediction
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Run the cells to execute the code and see the predictions.

## Results

The final model will provide predictions for food delivery times based on the input features. Evaluation metrics will demonstrate the model's accuracy and reliability.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in optimizing food delivery processes and enhancing customer satisfaction. Further improvements can be made by incorporating additional data sources or advanced algorithms.
